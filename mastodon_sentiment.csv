"Eliminating Hamas doesn‚Äôt justify the destruction Israel is inflicting on Gaza.Depriving the seriously ill of electricity, or premature babies of incubators, or surgical patients of anesthetics and proper lighting rightly strike many people as a bridge too far. In recent days, as Al-Shifa hospital‚Äôs care has ground to a halt, it has had to resort to burying the dead in mass graves, and the hospital‚Äôs manager said dogs had begun feeding on corpses strewn on open ground. Unless there was heavy and active armed resistance to Israel from inside or underneath the hospital itself, it will be hard to justify the Israeli campaign against Al-Shifa, which is likely why U.S. President Joe Biden has  belatedly come around to publicly calling on Israel to protect human life there.In a larger sense, though, Al-Shifa might be judged as almost beside the point. That is because of the nature of the broader Israeli campaign in Gaza, which has razed huge numbers of buildings there; killed as many as one out of every 200 inhabitants of Gaza; and driven a huge exodus of civilians out of the north into the overcrowded and also dangerous, if only somewhat less so, south of this embattled territory. Whether Al-Shifa is proved to have been a major operational base for Hamas or not, this broader Israeli campaign has taken on the quality of a collective and almost indiscriminate punishment on a scale that is rare in recent warfare.https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/11/17/al-shifa-hospital-raid-israel-idf-hamas-war-gaza/?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Black%20Friday%20-%20Sale%20Announcement%20-%2011202023&utm_content=Final&utm_term=oneoff_blackfriday23_11202023#gaza #alshifa #collectivepunishment",-0.020902014652014647,Negative

Police search turned his house upside down.This is what an Israeli father, who knew of Dr. Baruchin, wrote to his friend a couple of days earlier:""My son is supposed to study in the high school you manage in a few years [...] and as someone who knows Meir, follows him closely on Facebook and has met his former students, I pray that he will be one of my son's teachers and his classmates.""He then warns:The automatic, absolute and blind mobilization of most of the Israeli media in favor of the silencing and intimidation campaign we are now at its peak (or heaven forbid only its beginning) should worry and frighten every Israeli citizen, regardless of his political views and tendencies. Today it is Meir Baruchin, who despite having written explicitly more than once that he is ""against killing innocent civilians, against kidnappings, against rape of women"" dared in parallel, heaven forbid, to show compassion and pain in light of the shocking and heart-wrenching sights coming out of the #Gaza Strip.

Thus a resolution passed by the main council of the CV on April 10, 1921, concluded with the words: ""If the work for settlernent in Palestine were nothing rnore than a task of aid and assistance, then from the point of view of the Centralverein nothing would be said against tlhe prornotion of this work.

"#translation [reposted] How does a 14-year-old become a ""security prisoner""? Far too easily The first thing that catches the eye in the list of 300 Palestinian prisoners published by the Ministry of Justice, intended for release as part of the prisoner exchange deal, is their young age. The vast majority of them are 18 years old or younger, as required by the terms of the deal. And yet, looking at this list, one cannot help but wonder - how does a 14-year-old become a ""security prisoner""?For example, by throwing rocks at a security vehicle in Jerusalem. Another 14-year-old boy from #Jerusalem is listed only as an ""administrative detainee"". Arrested for what? It is unclear. Both have no organizational affiliation. Another young Jerusalemite, aged 17, has been sitting in prison for two years for the ""crime"" of ""throwing rocks and causing damage to cars using a stick"". This is in a city where settlers regularly attack Palestinian residents until they bleed, suffer serious injuries and prolonged hospitalizations - as a matter of routine - without the police bothering to investigate or arrest anyone. But a Palestinian boy will be jailed for years for causing damage to cars using a stick.More than anything, this list is dizzying testimony to the central place of detentions and imprisonment in the Israeli occupation and control project over the Palestinians. According to the HaMoked Center for the Defence of the Individual, as of November 2023 Israel holds 6,704 ""security prisoners"", among them 2,313 prisoners serving sentences, 2,321 detainees not yet convicted in court, and 2,070 administrative detainees held without trial.Not one of the 300 prisoners on the list has ""blood on their hands"". Almost all are relatively new prisoners, from the past year or two. The few exceptions who have been jailed longer are 10 women detained since 2015-2017, mostly Jerusalemites and West Bank residents, most of them charged with attempted or actual stabbings of cops and soldiers, some that resulted in no injuries, some in minor to medium wounds.This is in a judicial system that decided to close the case against a settler who stabbed a Palestinian youth to death, because ""his claim of self-defense could not be discounted"". However, self-defense under the Israeli apartheid regime is a right reserved for Jews only. While Jews who have rampaged, attacked and even killed Palestinians receive full immunity from the system, the Ministry of Justice list shows that Palestinians can be arrested by the truckload merely on the basis of the ‚Äúintention‚Äù to resist. One of the prisoners, a 45-year-old Jerusalemite woman, has been sitting in prison for over two years because ‚Äúshe was caught in the Old City with a knife. She stated her intention was to carry out an attack‚Äù.So while the Minister of National Security pleads with Jews to arm themselves and distributes weapons in synagogues like candy, Palestinians are apparently expected to get a license even to carry a knife. I do not know under what circumstances this woman stated her intention was to carry out an attack, but I would be happy to refer the Israeli police to the endless number of people who gleefully declare their intention to ""kill as many Arabs as possible"". I have dozens upon dozens of those in my inbox.But even the ‚Äúintention‚Äù to act without having committed any concrete action is not the lowest bar set by the indictments of the prisoners on the list. An 18-year-old from Jerusalem ‚Äúwas arrested together with others because he called out Allahu Akbar‚Äù. An 18-year-old woman from the West Bank has been jailed for months for ‚Äúincitement on Instagram‚Äù. I do not know what that ‚Äúincitement‚Äù was for which this young woman was arrested, but it bears reminding that in a state where explicit calls for genocide are considered legitimate as part of whipping up national morale, Palestinians, even citizens of Israel, risk arrest over posting a picture on social media of a #keffiyeh alongside a Palestinian flag.Among the prisoners‚Äô indictments on the list, only a few are related to actual shooting or weapons use (and even in those cases, as stated, there were no fatalities). In the vast majority of cases they involve throwing rocks or Molotov cocktails, shooting fireworks and ‚Äúdisrupting order‚Äù.Clearly #Israel has presented here a specially ""soft"" list of prisoners that in the absence of fatalities is not supposed to arouse too much public objection, and it is clear that in prison there are also Palestinian prisoners with serious and grave indictments. But this list, which Israel was able to rapidly compile, 300 names, almost all very young, almost all from the past two years, almost all sitting for nonviolent popular resistance (yes, throwing rocks at military or police vehicles is nonviolent popular resistance), should also elicit some reflection on the link between the harsh repression of any expression of popular resistance, and the strengthening of armed and violent resistance groups. That is assuming that the Israeli public will finally grasp the basic fact that as long as occupation and oppression continue, so will resistance.And following Nadav Frankovich‚Äôs piece here, we should also ask ourselves whether it was really worth holding onto those kidnapped women and children in Gaza for a few more weeks just for the right to continue incarcerating a teenager who dared cry ‚ÄúAllahu Akbar‚Äù, and many like him.Hebrew: https://www.mekomit.co.il/◊ê◊ô◊ö-◊ô◊ú◊ì-◊ë◊ü-14-◊î◊ï◊§◊ö-◊ú◊ê◊°◊ô◊®-◊ë◊ô◊ò◊ó◊ï◊†◊ô-◊ë◊ß◊ú◊ï◊™-◊®/#IsraelHamasWar #CollectivePunishment #WarCrimes #HumanRights",0.07786131725417438,Positive

Am Sonnabend arbeitet in Israel niemand. Nur Nicht-Juden f√ºr Dinge, die unbedingt n√∂tig sind. (Ich bin damals mit so kleinen Bussen gefahren, die mich von Tel Aviv nach Haifa gebracht haben.

They will be shopping and walking their neighborhoods in 2032. They cannot live any longer under a rain of Hamas rocketfire.  Long discourses on the ""Holy land"" and history hold very little interest to them, or to me.   The question of whether the IDF can end the existence of Hamas is an empirical one which we are more than willing to give a few months or even a year or two to test.  I agree that the prospects are grim, but not nearly as grim as those we face from stopping the kill mission and the hostage rescue mission prematurely.  Rabin notwithstanding, Israelis do not kill their peace advocates.

"@LordCaramac I understand your view but I disagree.  Palestinians in Gaza are prisoners of this cruel organization.  Civilian casualties are terrible now, but the alternative of allowing Hamas to continue to exist and inspire others around the world is far worse.  As the video I posted (which perhaps you are responding to) illustrates many Palestinians hate Hamas and yearn to be free of it.  That does not mean that they love Israel of course, but they cannot rebuild so long as Hamas, which rejects the very existence of Jews, holds power.The US killed hundreds of thousands of Germans as we destroyed the Nazi war machine and yet Germany found its way into democratic co-existence with Europe.

"It's not always easy to take Professor Ilan Papp√© for his word when it comes to vigorous historical research, but his commentary is always interesting, and in this case also self-reflective. ====The holy rage: the plight of the Israeli left My heart goes out to Jewish-Israeli leftists these days. They vent their distress on the pages of #Haaretz daily newspaper, while directing their anger at the global left, or at least the Western left. They are in a reality I found myself in some 15 years ago: ostracized and alienated from Jewish society for my ‚Äúbetrayal‚Äù of it on the one hand, yet on the other hand, not accepted as a credible partner by Palestinian society, whose national movement I supported as a researcher and political activist. Luckily that stage of my life is behind me. When you don't belong to any group of reference, you are in a societal and intellectual limbo. This is exactly the distress of the Israeli left. The massacre carried out by #Hamas on October 7 exposed the difference between it and the global left. The global left is an organic part of the solidarity movement with the Palestinian liberation movement.  This liberation movement is no longer as institutionalized as it was, and is much more fragmented and weakened compared to its heyday in the 1970s. But it remains robust and its solidarity movement remains as well. The concepts and language of the solidarity movement have always been different from those of the Israeli left. This movement has not supported the two-state solution idea for years, and has long defined #Zionism as a settler colonial movement and Israel as an #apartheid state.The sins of this movement, as they appear in the righteous indignation articles of writers like Eva Illouz,, Ofri Ilany, Haim Levinson and many others, are mainly twofold: comparing #Israel to colonialism, and mentioning the historical context of the massacre carried out by Hamas.  But the global left does not talk about Israel as part of global colonialism, but as part of settler colonialism. It is worth recalling, even for a moment, what characterizes settler colonial movements. These are movements of European refugees, who sought refuge and shelter from a Europe that did not want them and even persecuted them. They arrived in countries inhabited by native populations, who the new settlers saw as a fundamental obstacle to their dream of building a new Europe of their own.Destruction of the local population or its expulsion were a precondition for the success of this new settlement. This is the story of the founding of the United States, Canada and Australia. The Zionist movement was also such a movement, and like the other movements relied on an empire to gain a foothold in a foreign land, found religious justification for settlement, and engaged in the search for ways to get rid of both the empire that assisted it and the native majority population.Indeed, this is the perception of the global left. It includes defining Israel as an apartheid state, and was not born on October 7. It does not prevent condemnation of Hamas' actions, but it certainly provides a much more convincing explanation for this terrible event than defining Hamas as a bloodthirsty #Nazi organization that seeks to kill #Jews for the sake of killing.  Israel reacted with rage to the mass killing in the Gaza Strip, yet the Israeli left still expected the global left to be outraged along with it and relate to the horrors of that Shabbat outside any context. This is the global left's second sin, and this is the sin of the #UN secretary general: mentioning the context.The Israeli left demands focus on the event as pure evil without context. Mentioning the context does not justify it but explains it, and above all offers a different explanation than that adhered to by Israeli politicians, pundits and journalists. In vain, the Israeli left will ask people of conscience worldwide to focus on the horrors of October 7, and therefore forget about the horrors of the occupation and siege prior to October 7 and those of the days after October 7.  The global left has always focused in the past - both in its historical perception and moral viewpoint - on contexts that gave birth to difficult actions of those who rebelled against Western oppression. Therefore, those who supported the abolitionist movement did not see the terrible massacre of whites led by Nat Turner in 1831, an event that harmed the struggle to abolish slavery, as an uncontextualized evil. Those who supported the Algerian liberation movement did not demand constant condemnation of the terrible massacre carried out by the rebels in July 1962 of white settlers in the city of Oran as if it had no historical context of over a hundred years of French abuse and oppression of the Algerian people.These contexts explain the event, they do not justify it. They certainly clarify for us why the chorus of the Israeli left is shocked by what it defines as an insufficient response from the global left, and why its prominent spokespeople accuse the global left of anti-Semitism and immorality. As horrific as the massacre was, it does not absolve Israel of its past crimes against the Palestinians, does not justify the ethnic cleansing Israel is currently carrying out in both the Strip and the West Bank.  Moreover, and perhaps most importantly. As terrifying and horrible as it is, this is not a constitutive event: Israel will remain a settler colonial state, with features of an apartheid regime, Palestinian resistance will continue, global civil society will continue to support it, and Israel will rely solely on the support of Western elites. This is a clear recipe for continued bloodshed, with no winners, only losers, a reality in which calling for a ceasefire, which could lead to the return of the kidnapped, is considered treason, and the continuation of fighting and abandoning the kidnapped to their fate is preferred.  When the very mention of context itself is considered anti-Semitic, then pretext takes its place. The massacre serves as a pretext for ethnic cleansing in the Strip and West Bank and an excuse to muzzle and intimidate the Palestinian citizens of Israel. It also serves as a pretext for the United States to return its army to the region, from which it was expelled in disgrace after the failed attempt to impose democracy by force. It serves as a pretext for Western governments to severely undermine freedom of expression and opinion in the name of fighting terror.Moral compass and awareness of contexts exposes the pretexts and their disaster-laden results, and above all focuses on what matters now: recognizing again that Palestinians and Israelis have only two options: mutual destruction or living together.

However, this use will not benefit many others than the top earners and shareholders at Meta, simply because they are a capitalist company; capitalist companies are fascist in structure, meaning that most power is at the top (the major owners) while the least power is at the bottom (the artists who make music).

However, given the way that #Twitter's slow demise has led more people to #Mastodon, as well as spurred larger conversations and organizing about what people want #SocialMedia to be and who they want it to be for. Maybe Jezebel's demise will lead more people, particularly #feminists, to consider what we want our online spaces to look like and how we want to reach younger generations. Maybe it will encourage us to reflect on what we wish we would have had when we were younger and spur some creativity to foster that kind of community.

That's why Elon Musk bought #Twitter and is running it into the ground. That's why the #enshittification continues on seemingly every platform. They don't care if the #internet is a place for connection, and they'd much rather it not be a place for #activism and #organizing. They want it to be a place for their profits.

"Of course, #writing was precarious even when it seemed like blogs and other online, text-based publications were booming. That boom seemed to coincide with the 2008 recession, after all. But back then, despite the #precarity, it felt like there was still some hope. The #internet still felt new. #SocialMedia felt new. There was a sense that #tech could be a democratizing force. Of course, now we see that it's largely become a force for #fascism, with #Facebook and #Twitter amplifying authoritarian and white supremacist messages, people like Elon Musk spouting off about #longtermism, and our every move online surveilled and monetized. That's what the #internet has become, but that's not what it had to be, and I often wonder what kind of world we'd live in if something had been different.

"Mastodon thankfully is not filled with uncivilized people. Or at least, my overall experience has been positive.I joined Mastodon on Mastodon dot social on May 30, 2023, and moved to Mstdn dot social on October 12, 2023.  That means I have been on Mastodon for 5 months, plus 1 week (soon 1/2 a year)And in nearly 1/2 a year, I have only blocked 185 people. - That's itOn Twitter and Facebook (on my personal account), I blocked WAY more than that (so much more)#Mastodon #Twitter #Facebook",0.03666666666666667,Positive
@rvawonk I would actually challenge this a bit.I think the concept of nuance and 'grey areas' has been weaponised by propagandists and is often a symptom of the Kremlin's 'destruction of truth'.This is seen in people arguing that Russia's invasion of #Ukraine is 'not a black and white issue' Back on #twitter / #x I also found that the most common purveyors of 'subtlety and nuance' were #Trump-apologist 'centrists' acting as if they had special insight lacking in others.#disinformation,0.06560846560846562,Positive

"@Tain05 Welcome to the #Fediverse network!Firstly, don't forget to post your #intro (with that hashtag), as many fediverse users are following/watching that hashtag. You can also check: https://fediverse.info/explore/people Secondly, don't be shy in using hashtags in your post and on your profile description. Hashtags will help big time in content discovery.Now, the technical terms you might encounter, and hopefully won't get confused.* There are different fediverse software available, for example #Mastodon is the one running on your instance. Each software offers a different set of features.For example, there is #Firefish (flagship server at https://firefish.social) (bonus: you can attach more than 4 images); there is #Pixelfed (flagship server at https://pixelfed.social) which is geared towards sharing images (you can attach more than 4 images). There is also #BookWyrm (flagship: https://bookwyrm.social), think #GoodReads; and #PeerTube (think #YouTube and #Vimeo); or #Friendica #Hubzilla and #Streams; to mention a few.* An instance is the same as a server. Each instance is running on one particular fediverse software.* Different instances are interoperable and interconnected. They do this through the #ActivityPub protocol, which is a #WebStandard managed by the @w3c. * There are also fediverse group services like https://chirp.social and https://a.gup.pe - Chirp Social allows for moderation but requires creating an admin account. Guppe groups doesn't offer moderation features, however, it is the easiest to create (in case you are interested in starting your own). Both are free-of-charge.* There are also custom #frontend available. Some instances offer their own custom frontend. This is different from themes/skins. For example, this post, I sent it from the https://phanpy.social frontend for Mastodon. There is also https://trunks.social frontend also for Mastodon. Think #Twitter, but you're accessing it from #TweetDeck.* There are also mobile apps available. Some can handle different fediverse software, some only made specifically for one particular fediverse software.For some #history:* The fediverse was born in 2008-05-18 when Evan Prodromou sent the first message ‚ÄúThis is my first post‚Äù.* The term ‚Äúfediverse‚Äù was only coined on 2012-05-25 by Mark Eckenwiler. It was known originally as #Identiverse which was coined by Luke Slater on 2010-03-14.* The current protocol, ActivityPub, was started on 2014-09-06 and only became a web standard on 2018-01-23. The first protocol was known as #OpenMicroBlogging which later was replaced by #OStatus in 2010-03-04.For more links and resources:1: Fediverse software list: https://codeberg.org/fediverse/delightful-fediverse-apps2: Fediverse apps: https://codeberg.org/fediverse/delightful-fediverse-clients3: Fediverse history: https://codeberg.org/ddfon/federated-sns/src/branch/main/fediverse-history.markdownAgain, welcome and glad you joined the Fediverse network!",0.1888888888888889,Positive
